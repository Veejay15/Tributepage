He appears working as a terrorist from the organisation Akatsuki and serves as Sasuke's greatest enemy.It's eventually revealed that Itachi didn't murder his clan in cold blood. In fact, he was ordered to murder them by the leadership of his village to stop a coup d'etat, meaning that he acted in his village's and Sasuke's best interests the whole time. </p>

                <label><b>MANGEKYOU SHARINGAN</b></label>
        <p>The Mangekyou Sharingan is the 4th and highest level of the Uchiha clan's Sharingan . Aquiring it signifies complete mastery of the Sharingan, which allows usage to techniques such as Amaterasu and Tsukiyomi. The secret of the Mangekyou Sharingan is that only those from the Uchiha clan who have achieved the 3rd level of Sharingan (3 teardrops in both eyes), and have killed their best friend, may use it. Uchiha Itachi is the only one who has been revealed that has achieved such a level. </p>

              <p>Despite Itachi's considerable skills, he is quickly approaching his limit by the time he and Sasuke begin their final fight. His mastery over the Mangekyō Sharingan would soon lead Itachi to blindness and deteriorated his health, and the only way to prevent this was to steal his brother's eyes.his places them on even ground as the two of them exchange blows using their respective ninjutsu mastery. Eventually, Itachi gains the upper hand, but only after expending an immense amount of chakra. In his last moments, it seems as though Itachi is going to reach to take out Sasuke's eyes. Instead, he teasingly pokes him in the forehead as he did so often in his childhood. He then dies with a smile on his face, with Sasuke having fulfilled his now hollow revenge.

                <label><b>FIGHT SCENES</b></label>
        <p>Itachi's fight scenes are truly impressive. He was feared by the village including the top shinobis due to his ability including hi s famous genjutsu "Mangekyou Sharingan". One of the greatest battle of Itachi is with his younger brother which also leads to his death considering his detoriarated health status cause by excessive use of Mangekyou Sharingan. </p>
